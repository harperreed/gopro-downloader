# GOPRO Downloader

I needed a solution that would allow a client (in this case a raspberry pi) to connect to the gopro wifi and download all of the images available. 

Once the image has been downloaded, the script will delete the image. 

The original script was made by @KonradIT and was included in their [raspberrypi-gopro](https://github.com/KonradIT/raspberrypi-gopro) repo. They have also documented the API that the gopro uses [here](https://github.com/KonradIT/goprowifihack).
